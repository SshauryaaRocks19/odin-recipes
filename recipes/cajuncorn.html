    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled Cajun corn is fresh sweet corn, charred on the grill, and tossed in Cajun seasoned butterâ€”corn at its finest.</p>
    <p> It's an easy side dish for a summer cookout. I like to dip mine in Ranch salad dressing.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ears corn, shucked and cleaned</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes, for garnish (optional)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cut each ear of corn into thirds.</li>
        <li>Place corn directly on the grates of the preheated grill. Cook 15 minutes, turning every 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile melt butter and Old Bay in a small skillet over low heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer grilled corn to a large bowl. Drizzle seasoned butter over the top and toss to coat. Transfer to serving plate and garnish with parsley flakes.</li>
        <li>Voila!</li>
    </ol>
